This directory contains the following files:
    1) data_exploration_script.py - used to view data file details.    
    2) data_cleaning_script.py - used to clean data files.
    3) excel_file_append_script.py - used to append similar excel files.

1) Data_exploration_script.py can be used to view data file details.
   ---Functionality---
   This script will provide the following information:
	names and types of all columns
	length of table (number of rows)
	for each column:
	   number of unique values, percentage of values that are missing
	   for numerics: Min, Max, Mean, Median, Std
           for dates: date range
   
   ---Arguments---
   Display file details to standard output
   -f file name - the full path and name for the file to preview
   -s the number of rows to skip at the top of the file; default 0
   -e the number of example entries of each column you want to output; default 2
   -d the columns which contain dates; provided as a list e.g. -d 17,19; default empty
   -n the additional values that should be parsed as nan; provided as a list
   e.g. -n "#,NC" where both values will become nan when output; default empty
   
   ---Example commands---
   # view the data - specify that there are three rows at the top of the file 
   # which should be ignored
	python data_exploration_script.py -f [full path and file name] -s 3
	
	#view the data and make sure date columns are detected and all nans are considered
       python data_exploration_script.py -f [full path and file name] -s 7 -d 16,17,18 -n "#,NC"

2) The data_cleaning_script.py can be used to clean your data.

   ---Functionality---
      This script will create a new, cleaned, csv file as follows:
         dates specified will be converted to date times if possible
         values given will be converted to fans
         columns given will be removed from the file
         columns given will be renamed as specified
   ---Arguments---
   -f name of file to clean
   -s to skip that number of rows for all files
   -d column numbers of columns that contain dates
   -n values that should be considered nans
   -x columns to drop
   -r columns to rename, give list [oldname],[newname],[oldname],[newname]
   -o full path and name of file to which to write, .csv extension will automatically be added
   for example Unnamed: 5,Project Name to rename the column Unnamed: 5 to Project Name

   ---Example Commands---
   python data_cleaning_script.py -f [full path/filename] -d 3 -n '#,NC' -x 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,16,19 -r "Total Contract Amount (USD),Amount" -o /home/new_cleaned_contracts_incl_supplier



3) If you have multiple excel files with the same columns and you would like to append this data together into one file (with one master heading) you can use the excel_file_append_script.py
    ---Functionality---
        This script will create a new csv file with all the data from the excel files in the given directory appended together. By default this file will be named _consolidated.csv and will be placed in the directory given for file appending.
    ---Arguments---
    -d directory name
    -sl list of rows to skip for each file in order
    e.g. if you have file a.xls and b.xls in the directory, you would do -sl 1,2    to skip 1 row for a.xls and 2 rows for b.xls
    -s to skip that number of rows for all files
    
    ---Example Commands---
    python excel_file_append_script.py -d [directory containing excel files] -sl 6,7,8,6,6
